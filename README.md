# Social Application

### Objective

To build a social application that will allow users to share images that they find on the internet.

### Requirements

- Authentication system: to register, login and change or reset passwords.
- A follow system: to allow users follow each other on the website.
- A system for users to share images from any website.
- An activity stream that allows users to see the content uploaded by users that they follow.

#### 1. Authentication system

For this purpose I used the django authentication system which is found in the *django.contrib.auth* app. 

I have used django's built in authentication views which can be found at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/auth/default/#all-authentication-views.
